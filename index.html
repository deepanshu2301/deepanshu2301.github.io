              Being an Android user since its inception I was really excited by
              the openness of the whole platform, allowing the users to modify
              anything and everything in the phone. And since 2016, I've been
              exploring my way towards being an Android Developer by tinkering
              and playing around with the Framework, both as an App and a ROM
              developer.

              Recently I have been inclined towards my new found love that
              combines my knowledge of Mobile Development with Machine Learning
              to create ML powered mobile apps.
